### Running Locally

#### Prerequisites

Faber Controller requires `.NET Core 3.1`. Installation instructions for vairous platforms can be viewed [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

#### Start the Application

`.NET Core 3.1` comes with a CLI for running .NET applications. To run the controller, you simply need to issue the following command from the faber-controller root directory in a terminal:

For example on Linux:

```
$ dotnet run -p FaberController
```
You may see an output like:

```

      Now listening on: https://localhost:5001
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5000

      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Hosting environment: Development

```

You can now open your browser tab to either `localhost:5000` or `localhost:5001` to see the application.
